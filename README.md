# Plotly_belly_button

## Purpose
This project displays three sets of data. A bar chart displaying the top 10 bacteriea for each patient, a bubble plot showing the frequency of bacteriea, and a gauge showing the number of times a patient cleans their belly button each week. 
## Deliverable 4
On my webpage I added a background of a bacteria on my jumbotron by pulling a URL. I also changed the body font to Times New Roman and color to red. Then I changed the body background color to beige. Those were my 3 options chosen for deliverable 4 of my challenge. They are included in the style.css file.
